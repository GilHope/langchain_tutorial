# OpenAI LangChain Project

## Overview
This project is an implementation of OpenAI's language model using the LangChain framework. It showcases how to make API calls to OpenAI and parse the responses for various language processing tasks.

This project was developed as part of my learning journey through the [LangChain for LLM Application Development](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/langchain) course offered by DeepLearning.AI. Special thanks to the course instructors and the creators of the LangChain framework for providing valuable insights and guidance in the field of language model application development.
